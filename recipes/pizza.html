    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This kind of pizza is baked in an iron skillet or a round, steel pan that is more similar to a cake or pie than your typical pizza.</p>
    <p>Stuffed with cheese and topped with pizza sauce, it's as good as it is strange!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/3 cups of warm water</li>
      <li>2 1/4 tsp. of active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1/4 cup of olive oil</li>
      <li>1/4 cup of melted butter</li>
      <li>2 tsp. of white sugar</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tsp. of fine salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cup of cornmeal</li>
      <li>3 3/4 cup of all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 tsp. of olive oil, or as needed, divided</li>
      <li>4 cups of pizza sauce, or to taste</li>
      <h3>For the Fillings/Toppings (<em>in Order of Application</em>)</h3>
      <li>4 oz. sliced provolone cheese</li>
      <li>8 oz. fresh mozzarella cheese, cubed</li>
      <li>1 lb. spicy Italian sausage, casings removed</li>
      <li>4 oz. shredded part-skim, low-moisture mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>2 oz. Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
      <li>1 tbsp. olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Pour water into the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment. Sprinkle in yeast and let it dissolve for about 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface. Knead in extra flour if needed. Roll into a ball and place in a bowl greased with 1/2 tsp. olive oil. Cover with a plate and let it rise in a warm spot until doubled in volume for 1-2 hours.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, let pizza sauce simmer in a pot over low heat until very thick for 60-90 minutes.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (<em>220 degrees C</em>)</li>
      <li>Poke dough to deflate and turn out onto your work surface. Press and stretch dough out into round shape 3-4 in. larger than a 12-in. cast iron skillet. Brush skillet with 1 1/2 tsp. olive oil. Place dough in skillet; stretch and pull to evenly distribute it over bottom and sides.</li>
      <li>Lay provolone over bottom of crust. Scatter fresh mozzarella on top. Add sausage and firm mozzarella. Ladle pizza sauce generously on top. Grate parmesan on top. Fold edges of crust in towards center to seal in sides. Drizzle crust and center with 1 tbsp. olive oil.</li>
      <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until the crust sounds hollow and the pizza is beautifully browned for about 35 minutes. Let rest for 10 minutes before slicing. Enjoy!</li>
